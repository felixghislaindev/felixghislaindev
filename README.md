I am a front-end engineer who enjoys building user-friendly web apps, and everything in between.
Since my university years I've been  interested and facinated about web developpment and creating modern and user friendly interfaces. I've had the chance to immerse myself in many different works and projects, helping to make this world a little better through code. ✨😍

Most recently, i have worked on an application to help with distribution of personalized ad on social media platforms(Facebook, Twitter ect..)

I’am always trying to grow and learning something new. i lose track of time when learning languages, reading or listining to a good book.
